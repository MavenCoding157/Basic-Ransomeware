# **ABOUT**

This is a very basic ransomeware created in c# and was made in about 1 hour for educational purposes.

# **HOW TO RUN FILE**

To run the file you can either build it your self or run the 'setup.exe' file from either the 'debug' or 'release' folder.

# **IMPORTANT**

If you run 'setup.exe from 'debug' then it will run a slightly worse version e.g. you can still access task manager, your PC will not turn off, etc.

However if you run the file from 'release' you will not be able to ask task manager, your PC will turn off, etc.

This is not finished and i only made it because i was bored so some things wont work or be buggy.

Also make sure to run it in the file as the dll's are important.

# **FINALLY**

This is a real ransomeware tool and will harm your PC and we accept no responsibility with what you do with this tool.

# **LEGAL NOTICE**
